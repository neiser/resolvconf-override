resolvconf-override
===================

resolvconf-override provides a shared library to be used as an
LD_PRELOAD to override the nameservers listed in /etc/resolv.conf on
glibc-based systems (eg. most Linux distributions).

Usage
-----

To use the Google DNS in place of the ones mentioned in
/etc/resolv.conf you would run:
`LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/libresolvconf-override.so NAMESERVER1=8.8.8.8 NAMESERVER2=8.8.4.4 myapplication`

Invalid nameserver names passed as arguments are ignored.

Technical details
-----------------

The shared library overrides the `gethostbyname()`, `getaddrinfo()`
and `res_init()` system calls. It does not support IPv6, and might
be lacking particular system calls overrides for all applications
to work as expected.
